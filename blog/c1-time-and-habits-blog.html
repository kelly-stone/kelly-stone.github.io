        I have tried meditation and found it was an easy and effective way to release stress and reset my brain to fully functional status. Meditation is not unfamiliar to me as it is commonly seen in Buddhism.

        While I have only just beginning to try meditation, there will be a lot more practice and experiments to be done for mastering it. Of course, other timeboxing techniques are really useful and I look forward to trying them all in the future.
