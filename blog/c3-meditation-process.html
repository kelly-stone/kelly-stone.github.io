            <div class="question 1">
                <h3>1.How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</h3>
                <p>I like the way we learn from "Process over product", we could actually typing and seeing what comes out on the screen, 
                    rather than just reading. In this week learning is different to before, which we need to read and practice by ourself,
                    i had tried to read other websites and leart some features, and practicing on my own website.
                </p>

            <div class="question 2">
                <h3>2.Read or watch chapter 2 of Search Inside Yourself, and reflect:</h3>
                <p>
                    2.1 What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2?
                    <br>Before i read chapter 2, i know Meditation is like a yoga, you could clear your mind, and be calm.
                 </p>   
                <p>2.2  What new things have you learnt about meditation?
                    <br>i didn't know "software projects often fail due to poor team dynamics rather than a lack of technical ability",
                            yes, no metter where and what we do, team work is alway very important!
                </p>
                <p>2.3 Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?
                     <br>"Search Inside Yourself" i like to think about that, after a few minutes meditation, day and days after, our minds
                            become peaceful, that will help us optimise our learning and develop the sought.
