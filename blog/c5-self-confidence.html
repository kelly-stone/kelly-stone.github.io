                    <h3>
                        1. What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?
                    </h3>
                    <p>Mindfulness is an activity that results in awareness. To be mindfulness
                        is to discovering something that already yours and then developing and 
                        refining it through systematic cultivation and practice. Its like a 
                        practice strategy. Mindfulness and awareness always complement each other.

                <div class="question 2">
                    <h3>
                        2. Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel?
                    </h3>
                    <p>The body scan is a component of mindfulness meditation. I have tried to simply
                        lie down and do nothing, lying on my ned, focusing my attention at the top of my 
                        head and then move down the body. This trains attention, trains my mind to be able 
                        to move from detail attention to a wider awareness from one moment to the next.

                    <h3>
                        3.  What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?
                    </h3>
                    <p>Emotions are simply what we feel, not who we are, if our emotions are who we are,
                            then there is very little we can do about it. “Possessing this insight, one creates the possibility of change within oneself.”
