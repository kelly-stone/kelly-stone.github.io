            <h3>1) Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?</h3>
            <p>
            -HTML:Writing a normal document using a special format.
            <br>
            -CSS:Sytling HTML.
            <br>
            -DOM:The stuff that looks like HTML from the DevTools.
            <br>
            My analogy of HTML, CSS and the DOM is like making a cup of coffee. HTML is to ground and load coffee into a cup, spin milk,and 
            the milk into coffee. CSS is making different style of pattern in the coffee. And i guess the barista is the DOM, who could give a 
            visual repreentation based on the HTML and CSS.</p>

            <h3>2) What is meant by boxifying design?</h3>
            <p>Everything in the web is boxes, cutting off the web page into boxes from big to small, mark and locate the different, then apply 
            style and ready turning into a website. </p>

        <div class="question 3">
            <h3>3) What is the box model?</h3>
            <p>"box model" is used when talking about design and layout. The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content. 
            Explanation of the different parts:</p>

                Content - The content of the box, where text and images appear
                <br>
                Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent.
                <br>
                Border - A border that goes around the padding and content.
                <br>
                Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent
                <br>
            <p>The box model allows us to add a border around elements, and to define space between elements.
