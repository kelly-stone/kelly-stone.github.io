                        <h3> 1) What is grid based design?</h3>
                        <p> A grid based design is one that works in and around the constraints of a 
                            row-and-column-based grid system to help keep your content nicely aligned.
                        </p>

                        <h3> 2) Whats all the hype about responsive webpages?</h3>
                        <p>When using different size devicers on internet, the page will response and 
                            resizes correctly, like the page gets smaller as to make the browser smaller.

                        <h3> 3)What is semantic structure?</h3>
                        <p>Semantic HTML is the use of HTML markup to reinforce the semantics, or meaning,
                            of the information in webpages and web applicaiotns rather than merely to define its
                            presentation or look.

                        <h3> 4) Any other points you found interesting and want to reflect on.</h3>
                        <p> there are a few of the framworks we could choose from, which like Bootstrap,
                            foundation, yaml, 960 Grid and Susy. there are lots of funcitonality could 
                            save a lot of time, but i could also add some of my own style which will need
                            to add a new file call style.css. 
                        </p>
