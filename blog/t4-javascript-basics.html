                <div class="question 1">
                    <h3>1)  How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS?</h3>
                    <p>HTML-
                            marks the content up into different structural types, like paragraphs, blocks, lists, images, tables, forms, comments etc.
                    </p>
                    <p>CSS- 
                            tells the browser how each type of element should be displayed, which may vary for different media (like screen, print or handheld device)
                    </p>
                    <p>JavaScript- 
                            tells the browser how to change the web page in response to events that happen (like clicking on something, or changing the value in a form input)
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>2)  Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'.</h3>
                    <p>
                        For example, if you are developing an e-commerce application you may want
                        to repeatedly ask a user to enter a credit card number until a valid credit card
                        is entered. Alternatively, you may want your script to loop a specific number
                        of times through a task before moving on to the next part of the script.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>3) Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h3> 
                    <p>
                        JavaScript has only data type which can contain multiple values:
                        Object. an Array is a special form of object.
                    </p>
                </div>
