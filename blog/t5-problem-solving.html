                        1.  What was the problem?

                    <p>I had asked on Slack, and I google then I looked it up on other students answer.

                        3. How did you feel throughout the process?
                    </h3> 
                    <p>I feel pretty nervous at the beginning, but then i feel satisfy after the problem 
                        has solved.

                    <p>
                        I learn that the answer of JS assignment is not unique, we could search and learn
                        from many other ways and get different answers which are correct.
